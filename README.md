# General Information
  
  Litte linux combo editor, just a creation of me and older version available on aut0_mak3r. If you have combos, then you can edit it with this editor. 
  The Domain sorter has more than 1 million unknown mail providers for the reason, that the combos might be more HQ if they have unknown emails.
  If you have any errors, go here: (#bug-report)

# Installation

  For Linux/Termux:
  
  ```git clone https://github.com/rebl0x3r/combo_editor.git```
  
  ```cd combo_editor && chmod +rwx combo_editor.sh```

  Run:
  
  ```./combo_editor.sh -f combo.txt```
  
  Just replace the combo.txt with your combolist name.
  
# Email Config

  The Email config is used for the domain sorter, if you want to edit the file you need to use a strong editor.
  I recommend ```codium```, in Kali or any other system you can also use ```nano```.
  
  [1] First go to the directory of combo_editor
  
  ```cd combo_editor```

  [2] Edit the ```email.conf``` File
  
  ```codium email.conf```
  
  Alternatively you can add through ```echo``` domains:

  ```echo "@google.com >> email.conf; tail -5 email.conf```
  
  As you can see the last 5 lines, @google.com has been added successfully.
  
  Don't worry about duplicates i removed all duplicates and sorted the file.
